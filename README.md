# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Handwritten digit recognition is done using Jupyter Notebook for training a CNN sequential model. Data is fetched through a library, and the model is loaded in PyCharm for result prediction.
When you extract the files, you will find two files. One is a Jupyter Notebook file, which contains the training model, and the other is a .py file, which is used for uploading the model and testing it
Please note that the ".ipynb" file extension typically denotes a Jupyter Notebook file, so if you specifically mentioned ".jupyter" as the extension, it might be a typo or a non-standard extension.
